This example demonstrates how to work with the yapCAD Polygon class.
The Polygon class is a generalization of the simple multi-vertex
polygon (see the poly() function in geom.py) intended to support the
creation of 'rounded' geometry and to allow the calculation of
iso-distance lines.

In this case, we create a regular pentagon, then grow that by a
distance of 2.0 to create a rounded version that represents an
iso-distance line.  Then grow it again by 4 to crate another poly that
we sample to find the centers for 11 circles that are equally spaced
along the isodistance line d = 4.0''')
