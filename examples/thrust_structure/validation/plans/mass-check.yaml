# Thrust Structure Mass Budget Check
# ==================================
#
# Validates that the optimized thrust plate meets the mass budget
# requirement of < 1.0 kg for the aluminum structure.
#
# This geometric validation uses yapCAD's native backend and does
# not require external FEA solvers.

name: "Thrust Plate Mass Budget"
description: |
  Verify the thrust plate mass is within budget. The optimized design
  must weigh less than 1.0 kg to meet the overall rocket mass allocation.
