## yapCAD Polyline and Polygon example

In this demo we sample circles to find the points to create regular
polygons, then we use those points to create circular corners for
Polygon instances.  We draw those polygons in the 'PATHS' layer.

We also demonstrate calculating the intersection of a line with the
polygons in both parameter space and in XY space, and draw the
intersection points in the 'DOCUMENTATION' layer.

Finally, we sample each Polygon instance to create a series of
evenly-spaced circular 'drill holes' along the contour of the poly.
The circles increase in size to show the direction of increasing
sample parameter.  These are rendered in the 'DRILLS' layer.
