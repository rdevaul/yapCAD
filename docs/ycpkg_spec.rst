yapCAD Package (`.ycpkg`) Specification
=======================================


**Version:** ``ycpkg-spec-v0.1``
**Status:** Draft – initial workflow design



1. Goals
--------


The ``.ycpkg`` package provides a portable container for yapCAD projects, bundling geometry, metadata, validation artefacts, and exports. It is designed to:

- Preserve provenance and traceability (aligns with ``metadata-namespace-v0.1``).
- Enable reproducible automation (LLM agents, CI pipelines).
- Support incremental evolution (versioned manifests, optional extensions).

Distribution format is a directory tree or zipped archive. Commands must work on either form.

    Sketch entities now persist a `primitives` array alongside their sampled `polylines`. Each primitive captures the original parametric definition—`line`, `circle`, `arc`, `catmullrom`, `nurbs`, or explicit `polyline`—so geometry exchanged between yapCAD agents retains full fidelity. Export tools (e.g., `tools/ycpkg_export.py`) can therefore emit native DXF entities instead of approximating curves with short segments.

Key notes:

- ``hash`` values use lowercase algorithm names (``sha256``, ``blake3``, …).
- ``geometry.primary.entities`` lists IDs found in the JSON geometry file to speed lookup.
- ``extensions`` is the sanctioned namespace for custom data.


3.1 Validation Plan Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Validation plans capture the instructions for structural analysis, CFD, or other
design checks. Plans live under ``validation/plans/`` and are authored in YAML.
Every plan MUST include an ``id``, ``kind`` (e.g. ``fea``, ``multiphysics``), and
``backend`` identifier. The remaining sections are backend agnostic and may be
ignored by adapters that do not need them.

.. code-block:: yaml

   id: bulkhead-fea
   kind: fea
   backend: calculix
   description: Static structural analysis for bulkhead load case A
   geometry:
     source: geometry/primary.json
     outer_radius_mm: 152.4
     inner_radius_mm: 50.8
   backendOptions:
     outer_radius_mm: 152.4
     inner_radius_mm: 50.8
     thickness_mm: 12.0
     thrust_n: 2224.0
     radial_divisions: 32
     thickness_divisions: 3
     entities: ["solid-main"]
     mesh:
       format: inp
       elementType: C3D10
   materials:
     default: metadata/materials/al6061.yaml
   loads:
     - id: axial-load
       type: pressure
       magnitude_pa: 2.0e5
       surfaces: ["surface-top"]
   boundaryConditions:
     - id: base-fixed
       type: fixed
       surfaces: ["surface-bottom"]
   acceptance:
     stress.von_mises.max:
       limit: 1.5e8
       comparison: "<="
     displacement.max:
       limit_mm: 2.0
   execution:
     mode: local
     command: ccx
     env:
       CCX_NPROC_SMP: "16"
   attachments:
     - path: validation/supporting_docs/load_case_A.pdf
       kind: reference

Execution ``mode`` values:

``local``
  Run the solver on the same machine as the yapCAD agent. ``command`` should
  point to the solver executable (e.g. ``ccx``). Environment variables, working
  directory, and auxiliary options may be supplied.

``remote``
  Submit jobs to a licensed solver farm (e.g. COMSOL, Abaqus). Use the
  ``transport`` block to describe how to connect (``ssh``, REST endpoint) and
  specify queue, license token requirements, or project identifiers via
  ``options``. Adapters are responsible for staging inputs, monitoring remote
  execution, and retrieving artefacts into ``validation/results/<plan_id>/``.

Adapters SHOULD record a summary file ``summary.json`` in the plan's results
folder, alongside any solver-native artefacts (logs, meshes, field data).
Manifest ``validation.results`` entries then reference that summary and include
high-value metrics to make the outcome machine readable.



4. CLI Workflow
---------------


4.1 Package Creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


``yapcad package create <source.py> -o my_design.ycpkg/ [options]``

Steps:
1. Run user-supplied script to generate geometry.
2. Collect metadata from geometry objects.
3. Emit ``geometry/primary.json`` via ``geometry_to_json``.
4. Optionally run exports (``--export step,stl``).
5. Assemble manifest and write to disk.

4.2 Validation & Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


``python tools/ycpkg_analyze.py my_design.ycpkg/ --plan validation/plans/bulkhead_fea.yaml``

Steps:
1. Load manifest and requested plan, merging any missing plan metadata into ``manifest.validation.plans``.
2. Prepare a workspace under ``validation/results/<plan_id>/``.
3. Invoke the registered backend adapter (CalculiX ships with yapCAD; additional solvers can register via ``register_backend``).
4. Capture solver artefacts and summary metrics, update ``manifest.validation.results`` with status ``pending``/``passed``/``failed`` and timestamps.

``yapcad package validate`` continues to run structural manifest checks (geometry hashes, attachments). Automation pipelines should run both commands: package validation first, followed by any analysis plans. Future releases will expose ``yapcad package analyze`` as a consolidated entry point. The ``calculix`` backend generates an axisymmetric plate approximation, writes a CalculiX ``.inp`` file, executes ``ccx`` when present (and records deflection metrics), or marks the plan ``skipped`` if the solver binary cannot be located.

4.3 Metadata Edit / Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


``yapcad package annotate my_design.ycpkg/ --material "6061-T6"``

Updates geometry metadata via helper APIs, rewrites ``geometry/primary.json``, refreshes manifest hashes.

4.4 Export Refresh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


``yapcad package export my_design.ycpkg/ --kind step``

Regenerates exports, updates manifest.



5. API Surface
--------------


Implement Python helpers under ``yapcad.package``:

- ``PackageManifest``: dataclass with ``load(path)``, ``save()``, ``recompute_hashes()``.
- ``create_package(source: Callable, target_dir: Path, options)`` – drives creation workflow.
- ``load_geometry(manifest: PackageManifest)`` – returns list of yapCAD entities.
- ``update_metadata(manifest, modifier_fn)`` – convenience to mutate metadata and persist.
- ``run_validation(manifest, plan_id, runner)`` – hooks to validation subsystem.
- ``add_geometry_file(manifest, source_path, ...)`` – copy an external STEP/STL/etc. into ``geometry/derived/`` (or attachments) and register it in the manifest with hash + provenance.

These APIs should be usable by both CLI and programmatic automation.



6. Hashing Rules
----------------


- Use SHA-256 as default; allow override via CLI (``--hash blake3``).
- Hashes computed over raw bytes; store as ``sha256:<hex>``.
- When updating a file, manifest must be rewritten with new hash.



7. Zipped Packages
------------------


- ``.ycpkg`` may be zipped (``zip -r my_design.ycpkg.zip my_design.ycpkg/``).
- CLI must accept ``.zip`` by transparently mounting to temp dir.
- Manifest should include ``packageFormat: directory|zip``.



8. Future Enhancements
----------------------

- Layer-aware viewer interactions (already implemented) may evolve into annotated layer libraries.
- DSL compilation pipeline will eventually support signed modules and hashed invocation metadata per entity.
- Canonical-entity instancing will feed BOM generation utilities.
- Digital signatures (``signatures`` section) referencing PKI chain.
- Dependency graph for multi-part assemblies.
- Delta packages storing overrides against a base ``.ycpkg``.
Viewer & Validation Quick Reference
-----------------------------------


- ``tools/ycpkg_validate.py <package>`` – verifies hashes and geometry JSON.
- ``tools/ycpkg_viewer.py <package>`` – launches the interactive viewer.
  * 3D mode shows perspective/front/top/side quadrants, supports layer toggles (``1-9`` to toggle, ``0`` reset) and a help overlay (``H``/``F1``).
  * 2D sketches receive the same layer toggles, pan/zoom controls, and help overlay.

4.5 DSL Compilation & Canonical Entities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


- ``yapcad dsl compile src/involute_gear.dsl`` parses the DSL module, emits canonical solids/sketches under ``geometry/entities/``, and records exported commands in the manifest ``source.modules`` block.
- ``yapcad package assemble --dsl module:command=params`` resolves DSL invocations, deduplicates canonical geometry, and populates the ``instances/`` directory plus ``manifest.instances`` entries.
- Python fallback blocks inside DSL modules must live under ``scripts/`` and are listed under ``source.runtime`` for reproducibility.
- ``register_instance(entity_id, params, transform)`` helpers (TBD) will let higher-level assemblies reuse canonical geometry and populate ``manifest.instances``.
