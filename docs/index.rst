Welcome to **yapCAD**, yet another procedural CAD and computational
geometry system, written in Python_.  This project is still in a
pretty early state, though we hope you will find it useful.

.. note::
    
    **yapCAD** was created to solve some fairly specific problems in
    procedural CAD and `parametric design`_ , and at present is most
    developed for generating 2D drawings in the `AutoCad DXF`_ format.
    If you don't know what procedural CAD or parameterized design
    might be useful for, this may not be the tool for you.

    On the other hand, if you are tired of manually editing your CAD
    files whenever you change the thickness of a material, the size of
    a pipe fitting, or the diameter and spacing of bolts, *etc.*, this
    might just be the tool you are looking for.

    For an example and discussion of what parametric design is and why
    it might be useful see `What is Parametric Design?`_ below.

    Much of the documentation for **yapCAD** can be found in the
    **README** files, as well as in the ``yapcad.geom`` module
    documentation linked below.

What is Parametric Design?
==========================

`Parametric design`_ is a generalizable approach to solving design
problems by means of parameters and algorithms, as opposed to the
creation of static drawings or models.  Put another way, a
conventional design is like a drawing, and a parametric design is like
a piece of software that you configure to create the specific drawing
that you want.

the acrylic box: a parametric design example
--------------------------------------------

For example, imagine that you wanted to design a decorative acrylic
box to be assembled from pieces cut from a sheet of material of
uniform thickness.  This box will be a squeeze-fit design, so that it
assembles like a 3D jigsaw puzzle, without the need for additional
glue or fasteners.

You might decide on the dimensions of your box, and a scheme by which
you cut the edges to create tabs and slots so that when cut, the box
will fit together just so.  However, the depth of your tabs and slots
will necessarily depend on the thickness of the material, which might
vary slightly from sheet to sheet, or vendor to vendor. Furthermore,
your cutting tool (perhaps a laser cutter) will create a kerf, or
width of cut, that vary from machine to machine and with depth of
focus.

Finally, your box might be sized to hold a variety of contents, which
themselves might vary in size and shape.

One approach is to create a conventional design. You could draw your
design for one size of box, material, and thickness of cut, and then
hope you have your tolerances correct.  If there is a problem, or you
want to change box dimensions, you will need to go back and revise
your design.  Each time you revise, you are essentially redoing the
entire drawing from scratch.

Alternately, you could create a parametric design, in which the
desired length, width, and height of the box are input parameters,
along with the thickness of the material and an estimate of the kerf.
Creating a parametric design system might be a bit more difficult than
creating a conventional drawing, but once you are done you will be
able to generate the design for any desired box, from any desired
material thickness, with any kerf, simply by changing a few numbers --
automatically, and without having to revise any code or drawing.

.. note::

   For a **yapCAD** solution to this particular problem, see the
   ``boxcut`` example in the ``examples`` directory

This ability to solve for an entire family of related design problems
with a single parametric design system is what gives this approach
it's power and flexibility.  For anyone who has spent hours
re-drafting a drawing to accommodate minor variations in requirements,
this can be an impressive force multiplier on productivity.
