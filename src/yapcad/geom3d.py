geom3d -- functional 3D geometry representation for yapCAD
==========================================================

The geometric representations of point, line, arc, poly, and
geomlist provided by ``yapcad.geom`` are suitable for representing
zero- or one-dimensional figures embedded in a three-dimensional
space.  And while there is no requirement that the representations
provided by ``yapcad.geom`` (such as an arc, line, or polyline) lie in
the XY plane, many of the functions in yapcad.geom are explicitly
intended to perform computational geometry operations on XY-planar
entities. 

Further, while a closed figure described by ``yapcad.geom`` may
implicitly bound a two-dimensional face, there is no direct support
for working with two-dimensional surfaces provided by that module.
There is no direct support of any kind for working with
three-dimemnsional volumes in ``yapcad.geom``.

In this module we specify representations for two-dimensional surfaces
and bounded three-dimensional volumes, and provide tools for working
with them in implicit, parametric form as well as in explicit,
triangulated form.

The goal of the ``geom3d.yapcad module`` is to allow for the
construction of two-dimensinal surfaces and three-dimensional
geometry for the purposes of modeling, computational geometry, and
rendering.  Specifically, we wish to support the following:

(1) Support the implicit representation of three-dimensional
geometry, and the performance of constructive solid geometry
operations on this implicit geometry (union, intersection,
difference) to produce more complex implicit three dimensional
forms. 

(2) Support the implicit representation of two dimensional
surfaces, such as a planar surface specified by three points, or
the surface of a three-dimensional object like a sphere, and allow
for computational geometry operations on these surfaces, such as
intersection operations, to produce explicit one-dimensional
objects, such as lines, arcs, etc.

(3) support the conversion of an implicit two-dimensional surface
to an explicit, teselated triangluar geometry that may be easily
rendered using a conventional 3D graphics rendering pipline, such
as OpenGL

(4) Support for the conversion of implicit three-dimenaional
constructive solid geometry into an explicit, contiguous closed
surface representation using the marching cubes algortihm, or any
other user-specified conversion algoritm, for the purposes of
interactive 3D rendering and conversion to 3D CAM formats, such as
STL.

Structures for 2D/3D geometry
=============================

surfaces
--------

``surface = ['surface',vertices,normals,faces,boundary,holes]``, where:

           ``vertices`` is a list of ``yapcad.geom`` points,

           ``normals`` is a list of ``yapcad.geom`` direction vectors
           of the same length as ``vertices``,

           ``faces`` is the list of faces, which is to say lists
           of three indices that refer to the vertices of the triangle
           that represents each face,

           ``boundary`` is a list of indices for the vertices that form
           the outer perimeter of the surface, or [] if the surface
           has no boundary, such as that of a torus or sphere

           ``holes`` is a (potentially zero-length) list of lists of
           holes, each of which is a non-zero list of three or more
           indices of vertices that form the perimeter of any holes in
           the surface.

A surface has an inside and an outside.  To deterine which side of a
surface a point lies on, find the closest face and determine if the
point lies on the positive or negative side of the face.

Solids
------

To represent a completely bounded space (a space for which any point
can be unambiguously determined to be inside or outside) there is the
``solid`` representation.  A solid is composed of zero or more
surfaces, and may be completely empty, as empty solids are legal
products of constructive solid geometry operations like intersection
and difference.

The gurantee, which is not enforced by the representation, is that for
any point inside the bounding box of the solid, and for any point
chosen outside the bounding box of the solid, a line drawn between the
two will have either even (or zero), or odd point intersections (as
opposed to tangent intersections), regardless of the choice of the
outside-the-bounding-box point.

Solids have optional associated metadata about the material properties
of the solid and about how it was constructed.  

For example, material properties might include OpenGL-type rendering
data, mechanical properties, or a reference to a material dictionary
that includes both.

Construction meta-data might include the model-file and material-file
name from which the geometry was loaded, the polygon from which the
solid was extruded (and associated extrusion parameters), or the
function call with parameters for algorithmically-generated geometry. 

``solid = ['solid', surfaces, material, construction ]``, where:

           ``surfaces`` is a list of surfaces with contiguous boundaries 
           that completely encloses an interior space,

           ``material`` is a list of domain-specific representation of
           the material properties of the solid, which may be empty.
           This information may be used for rendering or simulating
           the properties of the solid.

           ``construction`` is a list that contains information about
           how the solid was constructed, and may be empty


Assembly
--------

Assemblies are lists of elements, which are solids or assemblies, in
which each list has an associated geometric transformation.

``assembly = ['assembly', transform, elementlist]``, where:

            ``transform = [xformF, xformR]``, a pair of forward and inverse
              transformation matricies such that ``xformF`` * ``xformR`` = 
              the identity matrix.  

            ``elementlist = [element0, elememnt1, ... ]``, in which each
              list element is either a valid ``solid`` or ``assembly``.
